## What is 1080p and 60 fps?
     
1080p is a term that refers to the horizontal resolution of a video, which is 1920 pixels. The p stands for progressive scan, which means that each frame of the video is displayed in full, unlike interlaced scan, which alternates between odd and even lines of pixels. 1080p is considered a high-definition (HD) format, as it offers more detail and clarity than lower resolutions, such as 720p or 480p.
     
60 fps is a term that refers to the frame rate of a video, which is the number of frames or images that are displayed per second. The higher the frame rate, the smoother and more realistic the motion of the video. Most movies are filmed and shown at 24 fps, which is the standard for cinema. However, some movies are filmed or converted to higher frame rates, such as 48 fps or 60 fps, to enhance the visual experience. For example, The Hobbit trilogy was filmed at 48 fps, while Gemini Man was filmed at 120 fps.
